🚀 Deploying a Scalable Web App on AWS Using Terraform! 🏗️☁️

Building highly available and scalable infrastructure can be challenging, but with Terraform, it's just a few lines of code!



🔧 Here’s what I built using Infrastructure as Code (IaC):

✅ VPC with two public subnets for high availability

✅ Internet Gateway & Route Tables for internet access

✅ EC2 Instances with automated provisioning via user_data.sh

✅ Application Load Balancer (ALB) distributing traffic

✅ Security Group allowing HTTP (80) and SSH (22)

✅ S3 Bucket for future scalability & storage needs



💡 Why does this matter?

I easily deployed a production-ready web application that:

🔹 Can handle high traffic with automatic load distribution

🔹 Ensures high availability across multiple AWS AZs

🔹 Uses IaC principles for easy updates & scalability



🔥 Key Takeaways:

👉 Automate your cloud infrastructure

👉 Reduce human errors with repeatable deployments

👉 Scale effortlessly with Terraform
